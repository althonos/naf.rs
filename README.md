## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

[Nucleotide Archive Format](https://github.com/KirillKryukov/naf) is a file 
format proposed in Kryukov *et al.*[\[1\]](#ref1) in 2019 for storing 
compressed nucleotide or protein sequences combining 4-bit encoding and 
[Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compression.

This crate provides a Rust implementation of a NAF decoder, from scratch, 
using `nom` for parsing the binary format, and `zstd-sys` for handling 
Zstandard decompression.

### üìã Features

- **streaming decoder**: The decoder is implemented using different readers
  each accessing a region of the compressed file, allowing to stream records
  without having to decode full blocks.

The following features are planned:

- **optional decoding**: Allow the decoder to skip the decoding of certains 
  fields, such as ignoring quality strings when they are not needed.
- **encoder**: Implement an encoder as well, using either in-memory buffers
  or temporary files to grow the archive.

### üîå Usage

Use `naf::Decoder` to iterate over the contents of a Nucleotide Archive Format,
reading from any `Read` + `Seek` implementor:

```rust
let f = std::fs::File::open("data/LuxC.naf").unwrap();
let mut decoder = naf::decoder::Decoder::new(f).unwrap();

for result in decoder {
    let record = result.unwrap();
    // .. do something with the record .. //
}
```

All fields of the obtained `Record` are optional, and actually depend on the
kind of data that was compressed.
